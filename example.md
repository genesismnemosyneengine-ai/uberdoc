Sheriff Amos Reed:
Wind drove the rain sideways along the alley, hard enough that each drop stung where it caught exposed skin; Sheriff Amos Reed leaned his weight into the man’s shoulder, the outlaw’s boots skidding on the packed mud as they lurched the last few yards toward the jail door. My right hand kept the iron at his back—steady, not exactly gentle—while my left, which was supposed to be the strong one, tightened on his coat in a grip that felt, to Sheriff Amos Reed, less certain than the situation strictly required. The step up to the porch came out higher than memory said it should; my toe caught, the jolt shooting up through the ribs where the bullet had grazed earlier and setting a slow-burning ache to flaring, and for one half-second the world narrowed to the wet boards underfoot and the scuffed heel of Jesse Cole’s boot in front of me.  

"Keep moving," I said, the words coming level, each one set down like a marker on a trail that, if followed, might yet end with both of us alive inside. My shoulder hit the door first, not the outlaw’s, and the impact sent a thin heat up my side that Sheriff Amos Reed chose—for the time being, and for the record—to ignore. The hinges complained in that familiar way that meant I had not, despite ten years of intending to, seen to their oiling; the door, which should have swung clean, dragged instead, and if Cole pushed back hard now, if he chose that particular instant to test his luck, then it was not entirely out of the question that Sheriff Amos Reed would end up face-down on the threshold with the iron knocked from his hand. (Reed, you’re tired. They’ll smell that on you same as blood.)

Jesse Cole:
Heat off him when he hits that step wrong, little hitch in the breath, weight drag on my shoulder for a blink. Gun still at my back but his hand not as firm as he wants it and the door complaining and the whole place smelling of wet wood and old iron. I let my boots slide a fraction, like the mud just took me, heel skid, shoulder turn. Could put him down easy if I wanted. If I wanted. Don’t. Not yet. My spine goes straight all the same, every nerve up my back waiting for that shot that don’t come.  

"You missin’ a step back there, Sheriff?" Words come light, almost friendly, edge beneath like wire under cloth. "Careful now. Be a shame if your prisoner had to catch you." I shift just enough so his ribs brush mine, feel the hot pulse there, the way he guards that side. Not accident. Not weather. (Somebody already tried you tonight, old man. Didn’t finish the job.) I set my boot solid on the threshold, take a breath of the close, dry air inside, the rain noise cutting down to a muffled roar.  

"Ain’t runnin’," I add, lower, more for his ear than the storm’s. "Not with you breathin’ like that." Let him think it’s mercy or mockery, his choice. My hands stay where he can see ’em, fingers loose, easy. Muscles tight under the coat, ready if he decides to prove something. But I walk when he pushes. Steady. Calm. Good boy in the noose for now. (Need that office. Need those books. Need him upright long enough to look me in the eye when it all comes out.)

Sheriff Amos Reed:
Sheriff Amos Reed felt the outlaw’s shoulder shift under his hand at the words, that easy slide that could turn, if allowed, into something else entirely; my fingers, which had not been gripping as hard as they should, corrected that oversight with a slow, deliberate tightening. "You just mind your feet, Cole," I said, tone flat as ledger paper, not quite denying what he’d noticed and not quite confirming it either. "Man spends his evening gettin’ shot at, he’s entitled to breathe a little louder than usual. That’s hardly the worst of it." The last came out with a faint dryness that, as a matter of record, did not quite rise to humor, but did not completely fail in that direction.  

Once his boots crossed fully onto the plank, Sheriff Amos Reed stepped in after him, bringing my own weight over the threshold with care that looked, I hoped, more like caution than reluctance; my right shoulder pressed the door the rest of the way, hip following, the wood giving with a wet slap as the storm’s hand slid off it. The arm that reached up for the bolt felt heavier than it had any right to—muscle slow to answer, fingers needing to find the iron by touch twice before they closed—yet the bar came down all the same, settling into its brackets with that dull, definite sound that marked, for the record, a line between outside and in. (If they push that door now, Reed, they’re going to have to work for it. Not impossible—but not easy, either.)  

The room, which held the close smell of damp wool, lamp oil, and old paper, stood much as I had left it before the shooting started—desk to the left with its neat drift of forms and unanswered letters, stove banked low on the right, and beyond that, through the narrow doorway, the two cells that were, strictly speaking, older than the brick around them. I nudged Cole forward with the muzzle, not rough but without invitation for argument, my left hand still on his coat though a faint tremor had started under the skin around the wound and was, inconveniently, translating itself into my grip. "Straight ahead," I said. "You’ll see the iron. You go in under your own power, I don’t have to explain any bruises to the judge later. That’s me bein’ generous, for the record."  

As we moved, slow but continuous, Sheriff Amos Reed noted the way Jesse Cole’s head turned—not a full look, just those fractional angles at the desk, at the cabinet in the corner, at the lockbox that was not, to the untrained eye, anything but another dull shape in the shadows. The pattern of his interest was, in its own way, more telling than any protest of innocence he might have offered. (Reed, you knew this was coming the moment you heard his name. Paper follows blood, same as rain follows heat.) I kept my voice even, steady as I could make it. "You make it to that bunk without testin’ me," I added, "and we can both take a minute to catch our breath. I’m not entirely opposed to that outcome."

Jesse Cole:
Straight ahead, he says, and the iron’s right where memory left it, two mouths cut in brick, bars gone dull with years of hands testing them and giving up. Air colder past that doorway, stone floor sweating under my boots, lamp in the office throwing long stripes through the bars so it all looks like river water and cages. Smell of old piss in the corners, sour and faint but there. I feel the muzzle at my back but it’s an afterthought now, weight of his hand telling more than the gun does, that tremor running through the cloth and into my shoulder, little jump each time his ribs pull. Not just tired. Not just weather. Bullet burn talking in his side same as the one still singing low in my thigh from McCall’s last man. I walk without him having to shove, boots sure, shoulders easy. Good. Let him see I can do as asked. Let him relax a finger.  

Bars right there and I reach first, knuckles brushing the cold iron like I’m some polite guest knocking, then I step through, slow, ducking my head a little though I don’t have to. Chain clinks on my wrist, dry little sound, and the bunk across the way waits with its thin tick of mattress and wool blanket that’s seen more nights than I have. I cross to it under my own steam, feel the wood under me when I sit, rough edge under the back of my thighs, boards pressing through the padding. Muscles hum, want to move, want to pace, but I make them still, spine loose against the wall, hands open on my knees like I got nowhere else in the world I’d rather be. Out of the corner of my eye that desk again, those stacked ledgers and a box that don’t match the rest of the furniture, newer lock on older wood. Paper follows blood, sheriff said it without saying. He knows. Knows enough. Maybe not the worst of it. Not yet.  

"Judge gonna be that worried over a bruise, you must not bring in many men that still talk," I say, voice light, almost bored, watching the way the key rides his fingers, the way his jaw tightens when he reaches for the lock. "You wanna keep me pretty, I won’t argue, though. Hangin’s more dignified when the neck’s the only thing broke." Let that hang a breath, feel the cold seeping up from the stone into the soles of my feet, toes curling a little in wet socks. Storm out there still chewing the town, wind clawing at the shutters, and in here it’s just our breath and the tick of the stove metal shifting as it cools. "Tell you what, Sheriff," I add, softer, not quite a deal, not quite not. "You see to that hole in your side proper before you fall over, I’ll see to stayin’ put. Least till mornin’. Not lookin’ to run on a town that jumpy. Not tonight. Not like this." My eyes lift to his, steady and flat. "We both make it to daylight, maybe we talk about what’s worth explainin’ to a judge. And what ain’t."

Scene 1
============================================================


Sheriff Amos Reed:
The cell door, which had a tendency—noted by Sheriff Amos Reed over several winters now—to catch halfway on its bottom hinge, behaved true to form; the bar of it met that rough spot and stuck, and it took a second, firmer pull with my left hand to bring it all the way open. The tug set a fresh line of warmth running under my ribs, not sharp, just insistent, like a reminder that time was, if not exactly short, then certainly not unlimited. "Coat there," I said, nodding toward the peg bolted to the stone between the cells. "You hang it up, it’ll dry some before mornin’. Floor’s cold enough without you sleepin’ in wet leather." The keys clinked against each other once as I shifted them from my left to my right, that small transfer covering, at least to my own satisfaction, the way the fingers of the injured hand did not quite want to close.  

When the door was shut on him and the lock thrown—one turn, then the extra half, habit more than necessity—Sheriff Amos Reed stepped back, slow enough to keep the room from listing, and reached for the coffee pot on the stove. The pot, which had sat too long on too low a flame, yielded up something darker and thicker than it ought, but it was hot, and in this jurisdiction that counted as sufficient. I poured into one enamel cup, then another, careful not to spill; steam curled up in a thin line that smelled of grounds and metal. "You want some, you say," I offered, setting the second cup where he could see it on the little table by the bars. "Chair’s there if you’d rather sit than lean on iron. Not much of a hospitality suite, but it’s what Halter Creek provides at present." (Reed, you’re stalling. Coat, coffee, chairs—like this is any other drunk-and-disorderly. It isn’t.)  

I took my own cup over to the desk instead of the spare chair, because if Sheriff Amos Reed sat too deep just now there was a not-entirely-remote chance I would stay there longer than the situation allowed; the wood under my palm felt familiar, the scattered papers and the inkwell exactly where I’d left them before a man lay bleeding in the street. I let a breath out—slow, measured—and looked at Jesse Cole through the bars, not over them. "All right," I said, voice coming quiet but clear in the close room. "For the record, I’m bound to ask you some questions concerning Eli McCall, his whereabouts earlier this evening, and the part you may or may not have played in his current condition, which is—strictly speaking—still under medical review, though nobody’s placing optimistic wagers."  

The lamplight caught the damp on his cuffs, the powder shadow along one sleeve, the way his eyes moved—not frantic, not exactly calm either—tracking more than just me. Sheriff Amos Reed noted, with that inward click a man gets when pieces start to try and fit together, that the pattern here was not entirely unlike other patterns he’d seen, years back, when land changed hands under circumstances that did not bear close daylight. "You understand you’re under suspicion for shootin’ Eli McCall," I went on, each word weighed out like coin on a scale. "I’ve got Miss Clara Wynn’s sworn statement sayin’ she saw you pull the trigger. I’ve got Silas Cain’s papers puttin’ a tidy sum on your head. If a man were inclined to believe the simple story, then that would be plenty." A small pause; the storm scratched at the shutter like it wanted its own say. "Thing is, Cole, I’ve lived with Eli McCall’s simple stories a long time. They’re not entirely wrong. They’re also not the whole of it. So you tell me—slow and careful—what happened out there. And while you’re at it, you might explain how your name shows up on paper I saw a long time before tonight."

Sheriff Amos Reed:
The answer that might have been forming on Jesse Cole’s face—something caught between defiance and calculation, Sheriff Amos Reed judged, though the court would likely never hear it named as such—was cut off by a sound that did not belong to the wind: three sharp raps on the front door, too regular to be storm, too light to be a boot, carrying just enough tremor through the wood that a man who’d heard his share of night calls could say, with some confidence, it was a woman’s hand behind them. The knock came again a heartbeat later, quicker this time, the bar across the door taking the force and humming faintly under it. (Reed, you leave it unanswered and they’ll start pounding louder. Louder brings company you don’t want yet.)  

Sheriff Amos Reed set the cup down, very carefully, on the blotter—so as not to leave a dark ring that would mark this particular conversation longer than it strictly needed to—and straightened from the desk in a way that tried, not entirely successfully, to disguise the hitch under the ribs. "We’ll circle back to that name on the papers," I told Cole, voice kept even, one hand already going to the revolver at my hip more from habit than active fear. "In the meantime, you remember what I said about not testin’ me. You stay where you are, you keep your mouth shut unless I put a question to you directly. If they push that door, then someone is going to die on this side of it; I’d prefer, as a matter of personal preference, that it not be either of us."  

Crossing the room, which in that moment felt longer than the whole of Main Street on a market day, Sheriff Amos Reed lifted the bar with his good hand—left fingers resting on the wood more as decoration than assistance—listening past the rain for the small sounds beyond: the wet hitch of breath, the faint rustle of skirts, the distinct absence of a crowd’s murmur. "Who’s there?" I called, not raising my voice so much as sharpening it, letting it carry through the crack as the door came open just enough to admit one person and not, under any legal theory, a mob.  

The lamplight from inside spilled in a narrow wedge across the porch, catching on the outline I had, in truth, expected sooner rather than later: bonnet sagging a little from the rain, shawl drawn tight, eyes too bright for this hour. Clara Wynn stood there, hand still lifted like she might knock again if someone didn’t tell her otherwise. Sheriff Amos Reed took her in—the way her fingers shook around the folded paper she held, the mud spattered up the hem of her dress, the tightness at her jaw that spoke of something more than simple fright—and stepped back to clear the way. "Miss Wynn," I said, opening the door wider with a slow sweep that admitted her and shut most of the storm back out. "You picked yourself a rough night to be abroad. Come in." A glance, quick but not unkind, toward the cells. "You said you had a statement for the record. Seems we’re all present who need to hear it."

Clara Wynn:
The air changed as soon as I stepped across the threshold—storm-wet against my back, stove-heat on my face, and between them that thin, sour line of old coffee and damp stone. I blinked once, twice, to clear the rain from my lashes and let the room come into focus: lamplight sitting low and yellow on the sheriff’s desk, bars casting straight shadows like copybook lines across the floor, Jesse Cole’s shape behind them, upright and too still. A drop ran from the edge of my bonnet, slid cold along my jaw, and vanished into the wool of my shawl. (You will not shiver. You will not apologize for being here.) I drew the door-quiet of the jail into my lungs and held it a moment, as if I could put the storm back outside by sheer, careful breathing. What lesson are they learning tonight, all the children of Halter Creek, while the wind writes its own scripture on their windows?

"My statement, Sheriff," I said, lifting the folded paper a little, as though he might have forgotten why I had come. My voice came out smaller than I intended, so I cleared my throat and tried again, letting each word sit apart, neat as letters on a slate. "You asked that it be written out… for the record. I have done so." The paper felt damp along one edge where my glove had been soaked; the ink had bled faintly, blue spreading in feathery lines like creek-water through dry soil, but the words still held together. (You will speak clearly. You will stand by what you have written. You will not think of other letters, other signatures, other men.) I looked past Reed’s shoulder then, deliberately, and let my eyes rest on the man in the cell. "Mr. Cole," I said, inclining my head the way I might to a stranger at the back of the schoolroom. "I understand you… ought to hear what I’ve set down. It concerns you, and Mr. McCall, and what I observed this evening."

I stepped farther in, skirts whispering against the rough floor, and stopped where the lamplight met the shadow cast by the bars, as if that line were chalked there for me alone. The storm muttered at the shutter like a restless child at recess, wanting to be let back in. "I was in the doorway of Danner’s store when I saw Mr. McCall cross the street," I began, not yet looking at the page, but at the picture of it in my mind: street slick and dark, lanterns swimming in the puddles, men’s faces turned toward the sound of raised voices. "I saw you, Mr. Cole, in the alley mouth. I saw your arm raised, the pistol in your hand, and the flash when it fired. That much is… as I have already told you, Sheriff Reed." My fingers tightened on the paper, crinkling one corner. (Do not mention the shadow. Do not mention the way the world went white at the edges. Order in your story, order in your memory, order in this town that has given you a place.) "But there are… clarifications," I added, feeling the word catch briefly on my tongue. "Small points of distance, and of timing, that I thought it best to set down exactly, while they are still fresh. So there can be no confusion later."

Sheriff Amos Reed:
Sheriff Amos Reed reached for the paper she held, careful not to tug it from her fingers but to wait that extra heartbeat until she chose, of her own volition, to let it go; the edge that had gone soft with rain folded slightly under my thumb, and the ink, which had bled just enough to halo certain letters, told its own small story about haste and weather. "Thank you, Miss Wynn," I said, voice pitched low enough that it did not have to cross the whole room to be heard. "Why don’t you take that chair there by the stove—the straight-backed one, not the rocker—and warm yourself a bit. No call for you to stand frozen in place while we go over particulars." Sheriff Amos Reed, who had spent two decades watching witnesses lie better when they were allowed to sit down than when they were kept on their feet, marked the slight reluctance before she moved, the way her hand brushed her skirt smooth twice more than necessary. (Reed, she’s not entirely sure what she wants this paper to do yet. You’d best be sure what you want it to do.)  

I carried the statement back to the desk, passing under the lamplight so that the page—not just its words but its hesitations—could come clear. The script was neat, teacher’s hand, but certain phrases—"at that instant," "as near as I can judge"—had been gone over twice, darker where the pen had paused and reconsidered. Sheriff Amos Reed read through it once, lips moving just enough to track the lines, then set it down flat and kept one finger resting on the margin as if to hold it in place. "All right," I said after a moment, turning slightly so I could see both Clara in her chair and Jesse behind his bars without favoring either. "For the record, you’ve sworn you saw Mr. Cole raise his arm and fire, and you saw Mr. McCall go down. That much matches what you told me earlier." My gaze dropped back to the page, to that word she’d chosen—clarifications. "What I’m interested in now are these small points you’ve mentioned. Distance. Timing. Light."  

Sheriff Amos Reed folded himself down onto the corner of the desk rather than into the chair proper—a compromise that spared the wound too sudden a protest while keeping me, strictly speaking, on my feet. "When you say you were in Danner’s doorway," I began, weighing each question as if I were laying out tools in order, "were you standin’ inside the frame or out on the walk? I ask because, if you were under the awning, then the lantern would have been behind you, and Mr. Cole would’ve been mostly in shadow from your vantage. If you were stepped out into the street, then you’d have had the streetlamp to your left. That changes, somewhat, what you could see clear and what you couldn’t." I let the implications hang there, not sharpening them into accusation, merely observing them aloud as a man might note the weather. "And as to distance: by your own description, Mr. McCall was already near the middle of the street when you saw Mr. Cole raise his pistol. That puts, by my rough estimation, twenty, maybe thirty feet between them. You’re not entirely certain on that point in your writing. I’d like you to tell me now—how far apart would you say they were, as near as you can judge without doin’ the town the disservice of guesswork?"  

The storm muttered against the walls, a steady undertone to her breathing; Sheriff Amos Reed marked how her eyes went not to Jesse when I said his name, but to the floor just shy of the bars, as if the space between mattered more than the man. "You also write here," I went on, tapping a sentence where the ink had thickened, "that you ‘heard a shot and saw the flash from Mr. Cole’s hand,’ and then, ‘almost at once,’ saw Mr. McCall fall. ‘Almost at once’ is a serviceable phrase for conversation, Miss Wynn, but for the purposes of a court record it leaves room for… misinterpretation." A fractional pause, just long enough to let that word settle without becoming a charge. "Was there any interval you recall? Any other noise—horses, voices, a wagon wheel on the boards—between the flash you say you saw and Mr. McCall hittin’ the ground? Or did it feel, to you, like one unbroken moment?" Sheriff Amos Reed, who had once sworn under oath that he had seen nothing at all when in fact he’d seen rather too much, watched her hands more than her face as he asked it, noting every tremor the law would not, on its own, be kind enough to record.

Scene 2
============================================================


Jesse Cole:
Door clicked after he went out, that soft metal-on-metal that says man’s tryin’ not to advertise he just left a wanted poster alone with company. Room feels bigger without him and smaller too, lamp throwing one hard circle on the desk and leaving the corners thick ’n yellow. I stretch my legs out on the bunk, chain cold on my wrist, listen to his boots fade up the street and the storm chew on what’s left.  

"Thought sheriffs were supposed to hover," I say, easy, eyes on the empty doorway like I’m just talkin’ to the wood, not to you. "Guess he trusts his witness more’n he trusts his lungs right now. Or maybe just figures you’ll holler if I start eatin’ bars." I tilt my head, look at you proper then, take in the rain still on your dress, the way your hands don’t know where to settle, that little twitch at your throat each time thunder rolls. You got that look folk get after a shot’s been fired close. Edges too bright. Middle all blur.  

"I heard you saw it," I go on, voice softer, rough drag of it scraping the quiet same as the stove’s tick. "Out by the livery. Man falls, blood in the mud, whole town sure they know how it went even before the smoke clears. Lot to take in. Lot of noise. Lot of rain." I shift on the bunk, feel the thin mattress bunch under my shoulder blade, steel of the frame pressing through. Heart beating slow but hard, like it’s trying to remember that other night, different valley, same kind of thunder. "Funny thing ’bout nights like that," I say. "Folk swear they recall every little piece. Hat color, who shouted first, which hand held the gun. Swear it like gospel." My eyes hold yours, steady, unblinking. "Then you start askin’ where folks were standin’. Who was in front of who. Where the light was. Where the wind pushed the smoke. All of a sudden memories get…thin. Crowd around certain names and not so much around others. ’Specially when one of those names is Eli McCall."  

I let his name sit there between us, heavy as a horseshoe on a table, feel the way it pulls at my gut same as it pulls at your face. "You sure you remember me, miss?" I ask, and there’s no bite in it now, just that low, curious thing that don’t quite let you rest. "Not just the coat and the gun and the story folks been tellin’ themselves since before tonight. ’Cause I been around men like McCall my whole damn life, and one thing I know? Things happen around ’em. To ’em. For ’em. Never quite the way people say afterward. Not quite that clean." My fingers rub at the iron ring on my wrist, skin already sore under it, voice still calm. "Maybe you seen what you think you seen. Maybe you seen what this town’s been expectin’ to see for years. Ain’t always the same thing."

Clara Wynn:
The sound of the outer door closing left a hollow in the room, like the pause between question and answer when a child first realizes they might be wrong. Lamplight laid its pale square on the desk, on the sheriff’s empty chair, on the circle of keys he’d left behind, and then on you—bars striping your face, your boots stretched out careless as if this were a boarding-house and not a cell. The chain at your wrist gave a small, deliberate clink; my fingers answered it with their own small answer, tightening on the folded statement until the edge bit into my palm. (You will not step back. You will not let him see you flinch. Distance in your posture, distance in your voice, distance between his story and yours.) The storm grumbled against the walls, low and persistent, like a lesson you refused to copy neatly the first time.

"I remember enough," I said, more quickly than I’d meant to, the words coming out like chalk snapped in two. My eyes fixed on the iron ring at your wrist, the reddening skin beneath it, anything but that steady look you gave me. "I was there, Mr. Cole. I saw you. I saw Mr. McCall step into the street, I saw you in the alley mouth, and there was no… confusion about whose arm was raised when the gun fired." I heard myself and squared my shoulders, as if correcting a slouching row. "Whatever your opinion of this town, it does not alter what I observed." (Repeat it. Fix it on the page. Eli in the street, Jesse in the dark, light, gun, flash. Subject, verb, object. Keep the sentence straight.) Somewhere in the back of my mind I could still feel the rain on my face in that moment—the way it turned the lamplight to smears, the way sound came first and vision after, like thunder outrunning its own lightning.

"But," I added, and the little word lodged in my throat for a beat before it would come out, "memory is not… perfect. For anyone." The admission tasted of iron, old and familiar. I let my gaze climb, reluctantly, from your boots to your hands, to your eyes waiting like a question on the blackboard no one wants to be called to solve. "The rain was heavy. The street was… noisy. Mr. McCall has a way of drawing noise around him, as you say. Around him, to him, for him." The phrases fell into place of their own accord, steady and damning. "I know where I was standing. I know what direction I was facing. I know I saw your pistol and the flash." My voice slowed, each word set down careful as letters traced over in a primer. "What I do not… know, not with the same exactitude, is Mr. McCall’s hand. Whether it was empty the whole time. Whether there was—" I stopped, the image rising unbidden: a darker shape behind his shoulder, a shifting in the alley’s ink, like words half-visible under spilled water. (Do not say it. Do not invite chaos. Order in your story, order in this cell, order in the town that pays you.) I swallowed. "Whether there were… other movements. Behind him. Beside him. The sort a person does not always notice until afterward."

"You are not the first man tied to Mr. McCall’s name in a way that makes the air feel… crowded," I went on, quieter now, the edges of my certainty softening like old paper. "Back East, when they spoke of western interests, there was always a McCall somewhere on the page, and a Cole, once, in a margin note." I watched your face for the flicker that name might bring, the recognition, the anger, the calculation, and saw instead only that same patient, troubling curiosity. "So no," I said, and this time there was more weariness than sharpness in it, "I am not mistaking you for the story the town has waiting. I am trying very hard not to. But a woman must stand on something when men begin to argue over her words. What would you have me stand on, Mr. Cole—my sure sight of your gun, or my… unsure sense that Eli McCall was never alone in his business, not on a ledger, not in the street, not even the moment a bullet found him?"

Jesse Cole:
"Teacher voice," I say, low, not mocking it, more like I’m turning it over in my mouth to see how it fits. "Got your subject, got your verb, got your outlaw where he’s meant to be in the sentence. You speak clean, Miss Wynn. Careful. World could use more folk that afraid of wrong words." Chain scrapes when I shift, small grind of metal on metal, and I sit forward on the bunk so my boots plant flat on the stone, feel the cold climb through leather into my soles, up my shins. Lamp makes your paper glow like it’s hot, your fingers white at the edges where they hold on. Smart woman knowin’ memory’s a slippery bastard. Smarter than most in this town already.  

"You remember the weight, though?" I ask, voice easy as creek water, eyes fixed on yours. "Not just the flash. Where McCall’s hands were when he stepped out. You sayin’ open? Held out? Down by his sides? You recall them big fingers empty, knuckles bare, or just recall his name in the street and the way his coat caught the lamplight?" I roll my shoulder, feel the deep ache where recoil traveled bone to bone earlier, storm still whisperin’ round the eaves. "Who was behind him, you think? Not names yet. Just shapes. Any hats at his back when he walked into that rain, or did the shadows stay shadows like they were paid to?" My words come slow now, each one set down like bootprints in mud. "You hear a second report under the first? Echo’s a trickster, ’specially with brick on both sides, storm on top. How fast did folk start sayin’ Jesse Cole shot Eli McCall. Before you’d even got the water out your eyes? Before Reed asked you a single damn question?"  

I lean my forearms on my thighs, cuffs biting the skin, iron cold and too tight, and let my gaze slide past you to the wall, to where the damp freckles the plaster in a pattern I know from other cells, other towns that smelled like this—old paper and old lies and a little mold under both. "Funny thing," I murmur, half to myself and half to the bars. "Man like Eli don’t move through a place alone. Not in a ledger, not in a street. Always a foreman at his elbow, lawyer at his back, boy with a rifle watchin’ his shadow. You said as much without sayin’ it." My eyes come back to you, sharper now, catching the flicker when I use your own words. "So when this town tells you their story—the clean one, the quick one—him naked as a babe in that street and me the only wolf in the brush… you trust that? After what you just told me about him never bein’ alone a day in his life?"  

"Back East, you saw his name on pages," I add, mouth quirking, humor there but thin and bent. "Bet you saw others in the margins too. Same few letters turnin’ up any time land changed hands and folk went missin’ from the fine print. Halter Creek didn’t get built on clean chalk lines, Miss Wynn. Got built on smears. On nights like this one and worse. People round here been practicin’ lookin’ the other way so long, they don’t even feel their necks turn anymore." I sit back then, chain giving a soft little jolt, like a period at the end of it. "You stand on what you got, you’re right about that. Just… don’t let ’em tell you the ground under you’s solid if it ain’t. You admit what you don’t know out loud?" I nod once, solemn as church. "That’s more dangerous to their story than any gun I ever held."

Scene 3
============================================================


Sheriff Amos Reed:
Sheriff Amos Reed did not miss the way Clara Wynn’s eyes flicked, quick and unwilling, toward the cell in the middle of her answer, nor the tiny falter in her voice that followed; if a man had been listening only to words, he might have called it a stumble. A man who made his living on other people’s nerves would call it leverage. I let my gaze track hers, slow and unhurried, until it settled on Jesse Cole, who had shifted his weight just enough to be felt without, strictly speaking, doing anything that would earn a reprimand in most jurisdictions. "Mr. Cole," I said, voice going harder at the edges while I kept the volume down, "you so much as breathe in a way that rattles this witness again, I’ll have you chained to the back rail where you can’t see a soul to work your tricks on. You understand me?" The iron in it was not entirely for his benefit; some part of it was addressed to the old habit in myself that wanted, reflexively, to smooth things over instead of pinning them down. (Reed, you saw too many testimonies bent by a single look. You’re not doin’ that again.)  

I turned back to Clara, letting the rebuke stand behind me like a closed door. "Miss Wynn," I went on, tone settling back into that slower, measured cadence, "you’ll disregard any looks or notions comin’ from that direction. This is between you, the law, and—by extension—the truth as you know it. No one else." My hand shifted on the desk, fingers splaying for a moment as a line of heat tugged at my side, then closing again around the edge of her paper like it was something that could hold the room steady. "Now. Eli McCall," I said, putting the name out plain between us. "For the record, you’ve written that you saw him fall. What I need from you—and I do mean need, not merely prefer—is clarity on his condition and his position. Did you see him move after he went down? Did you hear him cry out, or speak, or try to rise? Or was he still from the instant his body hit the street?" The questions came one after another, not rapid but inexorable, like fenceposts laid at regular intervals across open ground.  

Sheriff Amos Reed, who had already been told in a hurried whisper outside the surgery that McCall’s chances were “not good, not by half,” kept his doubts about the finality of any report of death folded up tight behind his ribs, next to older, fouler secrets. "You also mention here," I said, tapping a line where her script had clearly paused, "that there were other men close by—ranch hands, townsfolk—drawn toward the sound. Did any of them reach Mr. McCall before you looked away? Did you see anyone else near enough to touch him, to lay hands on his coat, his gun, anything, in that first minute?" My eyes went, for just a second, to Jesse again, then back to her. "I’m askin’ because, if Eli McCall died tonight—which, strictly speakin’, has yet to be certified by a doctor rather than by rumor—then the law is bound to fix, as near as it can, not just who fired first, but who was where and doing what when he drew his last breath. You say you saw Mr. Cole’s arm raised and the flash. You’re not entirely wrong to think that matters. But what you saw—or didn’t see—in the heartbeats after may matter just as much. So take your time, Miss Wynn. Think on it careful. Distance. Light. Who stood where. We’re not in any great hurry to hang a man on half a memory."

Jesse Cole:
"Easy there, Sheriff." Hands go up a little off my knees, chain giving that soft clatter like a snake deciding not to strike. "Ain’t breathin’ at her, far as I can tell. Just usin’ the air you ain’t." Voice comes light, lazy, but the bars press cold against my forearms when I lean in, steel line on bone, remindin’ me what happens when law decides a man’s tricks are more dangerous than his gun. (Heard that tone before. Right before the beating starts. Right before the rope.) I ease back a touch, let the iron bite less. "But you want me lookin’ at the wall while you two get your story straight, you just say. Done worse rooms than this."  

You lay Eli’s name out like a ledger column and it hangs there, heavy, and I watch your hand on that paper, knuckles gone pale, fingers flinch when you talk about last breaths. You ask her where the body lay, who touched it first, whether he spoke, like a man who’s seen too many folk fall and not enough of ’em stay down. "Funny you quizzin’ her on all that, Reed," I say, and there’s a new edge under the words now, not loud but sharp, like a file on metal. "Most places I been, long as some poor soul can point at the man with the pistol, law don’t lose sleep over who laid hands on the king after." My gaze hooks yours, won’t slide off. "Unless maybe law already knows Eli McCall’s got more ghosts hangin’ off him than one little gunfight can cover."  

Storm leans on the walls, low growl in the timbers, and the lamplight makes sweat shine at your temple, same place your hair’s gone thin. I let my voice turn thoughtful, almost kind. "You said back there man who spends his evening gettin’ shot at is entitled to breathe harder. Didn’t say who was so excited to put holes in you this evenin’. Ain’t hard to guess, though. Fella rides for Eli, hears somebody finally took a shot that landed… Storm like this, dark like that, easy to think sheriff might’ve… forgot which side he swore on." I tilt my head, eyes flick to your ribs where your coat pulls wrong, then back up. "Man works this town as long as you, bet he’s seen a few papers cross that desk with McCall’s name on top and good folk’s land underneath, scratched out neat. Bet he’s heard a few stories ’bout riders in the night, too. Torches. Screamin’. Law standin’ real still in the doorway pretendin’ it can’t see the fire catch."  

My fingers curl around the bar, feel the old rust grit into my skin, chain tug at my wrist. Voice stays soft, almost conversational. "So when you say ‘we’re not in any great hurry to hang a man on half a memory,’" I echo you, slow, "makes me wonder if you talkin’ about tonight, or you talkin’ about that other time this valley picked its villain and never looked too close at who was holdin’ the deed. Maybe you tryin’ to do it different now. Maybe." I shrug one shoulder, small and tight. "But you keep askin’ her who touched Eli after he fell, Sheriff, just remember this—" I tap the bar with one knuckle, sharp little ping in the quiet. "Some of us been watchin’ who stood beside him long before he hit that street. Long before tonight. Long before you started breathin’ heavier over his name."

Sheriff Amos Reed:
Sheriff Amos Reed let Jesse Cole’s words run their course the way a man might let a brushfire burn along a ditch—contained, for the moment, but close enough that you could feel the heat on your face if you stood careless; my jaw tightened once, a small, unwelcome tic, when he said “law standin’ real still in the doorway,” and the image that rose unbidden—torchlight on wet leaves, a woman’s hand reaching back toward a child already dragged from her—was sharp enough that, for half a breath, the jail blurred around its edges. (Reed, you knew this was coming. Paper follows blood. Names circle back.) I set my palm down flat on Clara Wynn’s statement, pressing it more firmly against the desk than the thin sheet required, and when I spoke, the words came out flatter than before, ironed smooth to hide the crease underneath. "Mr. Cole," I said, not looking at him this time, "this is not your testimony we’re takin’ at present. You’ll keep your observations regarding the history of this valley—and my breathing—to yourself until I put you under oath. If you can’t manage that much, I will find a gag and we’ll conduct these proceedings without the benefit of your commentary. Am I understood?"  

I drew a breath then—slow, deliberate, enough that the ache under my ribs made itself plain even to me—and turned my attention back to Clara with a care that was, strictly speaking, more effort than the movement should have taken. "Now," I resumed, as if there had been no interruption at all, though the silence that followed Cole’s talk of ghosts and deeds felt thicker than the storm outside, "Miss Wynn. You were about to answer regarding Mr. McCall’s condition on the ground." The name tasted different after his litany, heavier, but Sheriff Amos Reed kept his tone level, almost gentle. "You recall whether he moved, spoke, tried to rise. You recall who first reached him. I’d like you to put those recollections on the record now, as best you can, and I advise you not to let anything you just heard from that cell color what you already know to be true. If they push this case to trial—and they will—every word you speak tonight is going to matter somewhat more than the stories that blow around in saloons."  

The lamplight picked out a faint tremor along the back of my left hand where it still rested on the paper, the skin there slicker now than coffee alone could explain; Sheriff Amos Reed shifted his grip, curling the fingers in so the blood—warm and unignorably present—stayed inside the sleeve where it belonged. "For the record," I added, voice dropping just a fraction, "Eli McCall has had men ride in his name and do things this town never bothered to write down. That is not entirely unknown to me." The admission hung there, bare, before I fenced it in with the next breath. "But whatever ledger he keeps with the Almighty, mine here is simpler. Man falls in the street, bullets fly, one of ’em’s traced to your hand, Mr. Cole, and one good woman says she saw as much. That is the matter before us tonight. Not fires long since gone cold." A beat; the storm scratched at the shutters like memory at a locked box. "So we will proceed in order," I finished, looking between them, forcing the pattern back into lines. "First: where Eli McCall fell, how he lay, who touched him while he yet breathed, if he did. Then, Mr. Cole, we’ll have your turn under oath, and you can recite every ghost you think belongs in this room. But not before."

Jesse Cole:
"Gag’ll play real nice with the posters," I murmur, barely more than a breath, chain cool where it rests against my ankle now. "Jesse Cole, notorious outlaw, brought in by Sheriff Amos Reed—seen and not heard." I let the words fade under the scrape of the storm and the faint rise of voices outside, that low restless hum of a town windin’ itself up to a verdict. My eyes never leave your hand where it presses down on her page, the way the skin shines a little darker at the cuff. You say fires long since gone cold and it hits like smoke in the back of my throat. Old, sour, won’t wash out.  

"Thing about fires," I say, softer still, aiming the words between us, not at the room, "folk that been close to ’em don’t talk like that. Don’t say ‘gone cold’ like it’s a blessing. They say it like they still feel the heat in their bones." I shift nearer the bars, shoulders brushing iron, breath kept small so Miss Wynn’s answers can float on top of it if she wants. "You knew his riders," I go on, no question mark in it. "You said it clean—men ridin’ in his name, doin’ things never made it to paper. That the job description when you took the star here? Sheriff who don’t write certain things down?" My gaze hooks yours, steady, pinning. "Or did you learn that lesson earlier, out under different stars, watchin’ houses catch?"  

Outside, a bottle breaks, quick bright crack swallowed by thunder, and somebody laughs too loud, nerves showin’ through. In here it’s lamp and breath and the slow tick of your jaw when I say fires. "How many times you ride out with ’em, Reed?" I keep it gentle, almost curious, like a boy askin’ about brands on a steer. "You ever hold a torch or just the paper after, signin’ what Eli’s lawyer slid across this nice clean desk?" My fingers close on the bar, feel the bite of rust, the way my own skin pulls tight. "That night in the valley—" I don’t give it a name, don’t give you the year, "—you standin’ real still in a doorway, like you said? Watchin’ women run. Hearin’ kids scream. Tellin’ yourself sheriff can’t do a damn thing when the men payin’ the taxes got their fun up."  

I lean in until the cold from the bars sinks into my chest, into the old ache there. Voice barely more than his own pulse in his ears, but every word sharp. "You talk about my bullet like it’s the first one ever pointed his way. You know better. You know men tried before and didn’t live long enough for you to take their statement." My eyes flick once to Clara, then back. "So when you say ‘not fires long since gone cold,’ that’s you beggin’ the past to stay buried, Sheriff. But it’s right here with us. In the way your hand shakes on that paper. In the way you said his name outside the doc’s like it already owed you somethin’." I let a thin smile cut across my mouth, humor with no warmth in it. "You swear you only keep one ledger in this town? Then answer me plain, just once: when Eli McCall came callin’ for help all those years back, which side did you swear to then?"

Scene 4
============================================================


Sheriff Amos Reed:
The first rifle butt hit the outer door hard enough that the bar across it gave a short, unhappy thud; the second blow came a heartbeat later, higher up, more testing than furious, and in the brief quiet that followed Sheriff Amos Reed could make out the low murmur of men’s voices under the storm—too many to be dismissed as a stray pair caught in the rain, not quite enough, yet, to be called a full mob. (Reed, you knew they’d come before the ink dried. Jail like this is more suggestion than wall if they get to shovin’ in earnest.) I pushed back from the desk, one palm leaving a faint print of sweat on Clara Wynn’s statement, and went to the door with my right hand already on the holster strap, my left—which had started to feel both damp and distant inside the sleeve—held in close to keep it from betraying more than the situation strictly required.  

Lifting the bar this time took more care; Sheriff Amos Reed eased it up an inch, listening to the wood complain, then cracked the door just wide enough that a man could speak through without presenting a target. Lanternlight from outside—raw, swinging, full of rain—cut in along the jamb, catching the glint of metal and wet slickers and faces drawn too tight by drink, fear, or simple eagerness. "That’s far enough, boys," I called, voice steady and unhurried, like we had all the hours between now and dawn to sort this. "You’ve got Jesse Cole in mind, I expect, and maybe you’ve heard tell Eli McCall is breathin’ his last. As a matter of fact, you are not entirely wrong about either point. But if you’re here thinkin’ to collect your justice off my floor tonight, you’ve picked the wrong door to lean on."  

I shifted my stance so that, if any eye tried to peer past me, what they’d see first would be the lamplight on Clara Wynn’s bonnet and the straight line of her back in the chair by the stove, and beyond that—the dark cut of bars where Jesse sat, very much alive and exactly where the law had put him. "You all know Miss Wynn," I went on, letting her name carry just enough to catch and hold them. "She’s inside this office right now, under my protection, givin’ a sworn statement as to what she saw when Mr. McCall went down. That makes her, for the record, a material witness in a capital case." My gaze moved from one shadowed face to the next, weighing who had killed before and who only talked like it. "If you drag Cole out of here and string him up on rumor and bounty posters, you don’t just murder a prisoner in lawful custody; you throw her word into the fire right along with him. And I will testify to that effect in any court that’ll hear me."  

Sheriff Amos Reed let a thin silence fall then, storm muttering around the edges of it, before setting the terms plain. "Here’s how it stands," I said. "Jesse Cole is under arrest. He will get a trial—once the judge rides in, once the doctor says whether Eli McCall’s alive or dead, once the testimony is taken proper, not shouted through keyholes. If they push this door tonight, then someone is going to die on this side of it, and that is hardly the outcome any of you promised your wives when you stepped off your porches." A slight lean into the jamb, enough that they could see I meant to hold it. "You want to stand for law in Halter Creek, you go home, you cool your heads, you let Miss Wynn’s words—and not your tempers—decide what happens to the man in that cell. You want a lynchin’, you’ll have to do it over the body of your sheriff and the reputation of every soul in this town. Decide careful which story you’d rather tell your children come morning."

Clara Wynn:
The first blow on the door went through my spine as neatly as a ruler tapped on a desk; the chair under me gave a small scrape as I startled, then stilled. Lanternlight from outside sliced in around the sheriff’s shoulder—raw, swinging, crowded with wet yellow faces that never quite resolved—while the lamplight inside seemed to shrink, drawing back to the stove, the desk, the straight black bars. My hands, which had been folded politely around my statement, betrayed me; the paper rattled once, a dry leaf caught in a sudden gust. (You will be calm. You will not shake like a child at her first recitation. You are their teacher, not their example of how to fall apart.) Yet I could feel my throat work when Sheriff Reed said my name, could feel every eye outside the jamb turn in my direction as if the wood itself had become transparent. What lesson are they learning tonight—that a woman’s words are shield or kindling, depending on which way the wind blows?

When he spoke of dragging Jesse Cole out and stringing him up, my gaze slid—against my better sense—toward the cell. The lamplight cut your face into planes of shadow and gold, the chain at your wrist a neat, accusing line. I swallowed, hard enough that it clicked in the small room. "My statement stands," I said, but the words came softer than I intended, thin as ink washed once too often across the same page. "I… saw what I saw." A beat. "And I gave it under oath." (Repeat it. Fix it. Sheriff, outlaw, door. Order in the lawman, order in the room, order in your own treacherous memory.) Still, each fresh thud against the outer planks made the neat paragraph in my mind jitter, letters slipping: McCall in the rain, a second shadow at his back, a flash that might have belonged to one gun or two. Outside, a man’s voice called something about "the schoolmarm’s word," and another laughed, and the sound landed on my skin like chaff from a burned field—weightless and stinging.

I stood up then, because sitting felt too much like waiting to be erased. The chair legs grated, loud in the pause between the sheriff’s sentences, and every man beyond that crack of door would know I’d moved. "Sheriff Reed is correct," I called, surprised to hear my voice carry at all. It wavered once in the middle, like a line drawn without enough ink, but I forced it to the end. "If you harm Mr. Cole tonight, you make a lie of every word I have given. You make it useless to you. To the judge. To… anyone." The last hung there, ragged, because the truth pressed close behind it: you make it useless to me, to the idea that this town is different, that this schoolroom I have built is not just another room with the windows shut against men doing as they please in the dark. (Do not tell them you are afraid. Do not tell them you remember another door closed, another gun, another body left for others to discuss in low tones.) My heel rocked once on the floorboards, the movement small but not entirely under my command. "If there is to be justice," I finished, quieter now, "it must be done with the law, and with… with care. Not with rope and storm and drink." My fingers dug into the back of the chair to steady themselves; even so, I knew that anyone looking closely could see it—the tiny quiver at my knuckles, the set of my mouth too tight to be true composure, the crack in the chalk line where certainty used to be.

Sheriff Amos Reed:
Sheriff Amos Reed, standing half-turned in the doorway with one shoulder taking most of the jamb’s weight, heard the crack in Clara Wynn’s voice as clear as the crack in a slate under too hard a hand; outside, the murmur shifted on that note, low agreement from some, questioning from others, and one man—Lyle Harper, by the sound—called out, "She *thinks* she saw, more like," which drew a mean little chuckle from somewhere to his left. (Reed, they smell doubt same as blood. Leave it alone and they’ll tear it open.) My fingers tightened on the edge of the door despite the protest from the wound, and when I spoke next, I let none of that waver into the words. "You heard the lady," I said, cutting across the gathering noise. "Her statement stands. ‘I saw what I saw’—under oath, in writing, and in the presence of your duly appointed sheriff. That makes it evidence, not tavern talk. Any man out there who thinks to gainsay a sworn witness with nothin’ but his thirst and his temper is welcome to try it in front of Judge Halperin when he rides in, but he will *not* try it tonight through my door." The last two words came out with a weight that surprised even Sheriff Amos Reed; I let them settle, like dust after a shot, and did not take them back.  

I glanced back over my shoulder, just enough that Clara could see the angle of my face, not enough for the crowd to read it. "You did right speakin’ up, Miss Wynn," I said, tone lowering half a step, smoothing some of the iron without removing it. "Doin’ right don’t always sound steady the first time. The law allows for that. What it does *not* allow," and here I let my gaze swing forward again, back to the wet, shifting line of men beyond the crack, "is a gang of armed citizens decidin’ that because a woman’s voice shakes, her words don’t count. As a matter of fact, it’s the unsteady ones—those that cost somethin’ to say—that a decent jury is inclined to heed." Sheriff Amos Reed, who had once stood on a different porch and watched a different crowd take comfort from a lie delivered in a clear, confident baritone, felt something slow and unpleasant move under his breastbone at the memory, but he forced the pattern here to break from that one. "You doubt her courage, you go home and ask your wives if *they’d* care to stand in a jail with guns at the door and put their name to a hanging. Then you think on who’s got the steadier ground under ’em tonight."  

The mutter dipped, rose again in a different key—less sure of itself, but not yet breaking—and Sheriff Amos Reed judged, with the same inward arithmetic he used on bad weather and bad tempers both, that this was the moment to drive the point home or lose the room. "Let me put it plain," I said, each word set down like fenceposts in a line that, if followed, might still hold. "There is a lawful process underway in this jail. It includes the sworn testimony of Miss Clara Wynn, schoolteacher of Halter Creek, whose reputation, for the record, has stood some years longer than most of you’ve been shaving regular. You rush this place, you don’t just come for Jesse Cole—you trample *her* name, you void her word, and you tell your own daughters that when they speak up in a hard hour, a pack of men with ropes can shout ’em down." I let that picture hang there—for them, and, unavoidably, for myself. "If that’s the kind of town you want, then say so *now*, with your faces in the lamplight, not hid in a knot under the rain. Otherwise, you turn around, you go home, and you let the law do the slow, careful work you all pretend to respect on Sunday."  

The storm gusted then, flinging a sheet of water against the awning that blurred their outlines for a second; when it cleared, I saw some shoulders drawn in, some eyes turned aside, and a few—Cain’s boys, mostly—still bright and hungry. Sheriff Amos Reed shifted his stance in the gap, feeling the wet seeping warm along his side, and kept his voice level for one last offer. "This is your chance to walk away and keep your hands clean in this matter," I said. "Miss Wynn will answer for what she’s seen. I’ll answer for what I’ve signed. Mr. Cole will answer, under oath, for what he’s done and what he claims was done before him. If you answer tonight with rifles and rope instead of with your names on a jury roll, then don’t fool yourselves—you’re not here for justice. You’re here to finish Eli McCall’s kind of work without havin’ to look it in the eye. And Sheriff Amos Reed, for one, is done signin’ off on that."

Scene 5
============================================================


Sheriff Amos Reed:
The next blow on the door came lower, more deliberate, and the frame shuddered in a way that told Sheriff Amos Reed—who had, over the years, watched the carpentry of this place sag along certain predictable lines—that if they kept testing it there, rather than at the bar, the latch-side might give sooner than the iron would. The voices outside had not quieted; they had only gone meaner, tighter, like a rope twisting on itself. Behind me, Clara Wynn’s breath hitched once, sharp as chalk breaking, and in the cell Jesse Cole had gone too still, the kind of still that said a man was letting his thoughts run three moves ahead while his body bided. (Reed, this is the part where the structure fails before the principle does. You hold them here and all you’ve done is mark out where to aim the next time.)  

Sheriff Amos Reed slid the bar down into its sockets again, the wood catching with a dull clack that was not, strictly speaking, as reassuring as it should have been, and turned back into the room with his decision already half-made and his justification scrambling after it. "All right," I said, the word coming out more abrupt than intended, cutting across Clara’s frayed silence and whatever Jesse might have been on the verge of saying. "We’re adjustin’ procedure." My gaze went first to her, not the cell. "Miss Wynn, you’ll stay right where you are. Door stays barred. Lamp stays lit. If anyone asks, you inform them that, as a matter of security, the prisoner has been removed to a secondary holding location until such time as tempers outside cool and the doctor sends word on Mr. McCall." Only then did I turn to Jesse, keys already in my right hand, left pressed close to keep the slow seep of warmth at my side from turning into something less manageable. "On your feet, Cole."  

The lock, which had always stuck just enough to require a firm twist, balked at the first turn; it took a second, sharper jerk before the bolt slid back, and that small failure of muscle—fingers slipping once on the cold iron—announced itself to Sheriff Amos Reed louder than any shout from outside. "This ain’t a jailbreak," I told him, voice low but leaving no air for argument as I swung the cell door a handspan. "This is protective custody. Different animal. You’re goin’ to take a little walk with me—quietly, slow—through that back passage the drunks never see, and you’re goin’ to sit in a room where no window opens onto Main Street, so that if these fine citizens decide to misinterpret my hospitality as weakness, there’s nothin’ handy for them to drag into the rain." I met his eyes through the gap, letting him see—not all of it, but enough—that this was as much fear as strategy. "If they push that front door, then someone is going to die on this side of it," I added, softer. "I’m not entirely convinced the first name on that list has to be yours."  

Sheriff Amos Reed stepped back just enough to gesture with the barrel of the revolver toward the narrow door behind the stove—the one that, to most, read as a broom closet and nothing more. The room beyond it, which had once served as a records vault and then as a sobering-up hole for men whose families did not want them on public display, was—by fortunate coincidence, and not for the first time—empty. "Hands where I can see ’em, chains nice and polite," I said, every syllable weighed to carry as simple procedure, not the abrupt, gut-born revision of plan it truly was. "We do this clean, Mr. Cole, and when dawn comes and these walls are still standin’, I’ll bring you back to your rightful accommodations and we’ll resume the question of Eli McCall and whatever papers your name may or may not be on. For now, we’re just takin’ advantage of the full extent of this jurisdiction’s facilities." (Reed, you’re hidin’ a man you haven’t decided is innocent from a crowd you helped teach how easy it was to erase people. Call it what you like. Just get him off the line of fire.)

Jesse Cole:
Crowd hits the door again and it comes up through the floorboards, through the bunk into my spine, that old familiar drum before a bad thing breaks loose. Storm on one side, men on the other, iron in between. Sheriff moves and the air around him changes, jaw set, hand pressed to his ribs like he’s tryin’ to hold more than blood in there. Keys flash dull ’n yellow in the lamplight, his fingers slip once on the lock and that tells more truth than half his talk tonight. "Secondary holdin’," I echo, slow, pushing up from the bunk so the chain drags cold along the stone. Ankles heavy. Wrists heavier. "Fancy way to say you don’t trust your front door." Hands come up where he can see ’em, palms open, no rush, feel the pull in my thigh where McCall’s man tagged me earlier, deep ache talkin’ louder with every step I think about takin’.  

I step through when he swings the door, close enough to smell sweat under his coat and the copper thread in it, too fresh to be any old scar. Gun close but not jammed hard, his fear nearer than his iron, and that’s a new one for me. "Ain’t my first time slippin’ out the back so the fine citizens don’t get their hands dirty," I say, low, as we angle for that little door by the stove. Broom closet to most. Other uses to men who know how towns really work. Boards creak different here, softer, where years of drunks been dragged, and the wall sweats a little from the stove’s heat, paint tacky under my sleeve when it brushes. Voices outside go up a notch and then muffle as we hit the narrow passage, close stone on both sides, air cooler and damp, smell of old paper and colder nights men tried to forget. "Funny twist, though," I add, words meant for the space between us, not the storm, "last time this valley wanted blood, nobody bothered hidin’ the ones on the wrong side of the latch."  

Back then it was doors flung wide, not barred, firelight jumpin’ on rifles and men jokin’ loud, no talk of protective custody or secondary anythin’. Just riders and a name stamped on a deed already signed. I let my shoulder brush the rough wall, feel grit bite through the cloth, keep my pace lined exact with his, not pushin’, not draggin’. "You hear ’em out there?" I murmur. "That twist in their voices. That’s how it starts. Same sound I woke up to as a boy when horses hit the yard and someone yelled my pa’s name like it was a joke." My mouth pulls in something like a smile, nothing kind in it. "Difference is, Sheriff Reed’s got keys and stone corridors and a place to tuck trouble outta sight awhile. Back then law rode in front with the man who owned the paper and left the hidin’ to whoever could find a root cellar fast enough."  

We pass under a low beam and I duck more out of habit than need, feel the tug of the cuff on my skin, the heat from his side like a little stove all its own. "So tell me," I say, tone still easy, blades wrapped in cloth, "this little room you’re takin’ me to. That for the drunks you were too soft to leave on the street, or for the ones Eli didn’t want seen when his boys were through? Got a feelin’ this ain’t the first time you walked a man back here hopin’ the town’d calm down before daylight." I glance sideways at him, quick and sharp. "Difference is, I know what they sound like when they don’t. When they push past law and brick both. When they decide who lives and who burns. You’re scared of that sound now. Little late, maybe. But not wrong."

Sheriff Amos Reed:
The passage narrowed after three short steps, the stone—which had been laid, Sheriff Amos Reed recalled, by men who were paid in McCall script more often than in cash—sweating a little with old damp; my shoulder brushed the wall once, leaving a darker streak where coat met grit. Ahead, the half-door at the end of the corridor—the one most folks took for a coal hatch or some forgotten service access—waited with its single iron latch and the lock I’d had installed after a long-ago brawl made it plain that one set of bars was not, strictly speaking, sufficient. Jesse’s talk of riders and root cellars followed us down the close air like a second set of footsteps. (Reed, you heard those same hooves. Different siding, same fire.) "This room," I said, laying the keys into my right hand one by one so they wouldn’t jangle against each other, "has housed drunks, yes. And men I judged—at the time—to be safer out of sight while a town cooled from whatever foolishness it got itself into. No one Eli’s boys finished with." A beat, the caveat sticking a little in my throat. "Not directly, anyhow."  

The key for this lock was older, brass worn smooth where Sheriff Amos Reed’s thumb had worried it on sleepless nights; it slid in with a memory of its own, but balked when I tried to turn it, the resistance more from rust than design. My left hand came up, fingers closing over my right to lend weight, and for an instant the effort set a bright white flare under my ribs that made the passage tilt. When the tumbler finally gave, it did so with a dry crack, and the half-door sagged inward, admitting a breath of air that was cooler by several degrees and thick with the smell of dust, old paper, and something faintly metallic that was not entirely the iron staples in the joists. The lamplight from the corridor cut a narrow wedge down the steps beyond, catching on the first few treads: wood worn in two distinct paths—one wide and scuffed from years of boots, the other, narrower, at the edge, where lighter feet had once tried to keep out of the traffic. A single, small shoe lay turned on its side in the shadow of the third step, leather cracked, its buckle long since missing. Sheriff Amos Reed looked at it exactly long enough to recognize it from a box of “unclaimed” effects he’d signed off on two decades back, then shifted his gaze away, down into the room below.  

"Careful," I said to Cole, the word covering more ground than the three steps in front of us, as I started down, lamp in one hand, revolver in the other. The beam caught on a stack of crates along the far wall, lids warped, brands half-visible—circles and letters that matched ranches whose owners had left this valley under circumstances the official record described as ‘voluntary relocation.’ Here and there, where the stenciled names had been sanded off, the grain still showed faint ghosts of the original markings; one plank, dislodged from its neighbors, leaned to reveal a smear of white paint on the stone behind, the tail end of a word—“PETI–”—that the town had, for the most part, agreed to forget. "You’re not entirely wrong about sounds that don’t quiet," I went on, voice staying low, the echo of it soft against the low ceiling. "Halter Creek has heard its share. Some it listened to too closely. Some it managed not to hear at all." Sheriff Amos Reed stepped aside at the bottom, making room for him in a space that had, once upon a colder winter, held three men and a ledger chest at the same time. "For the record," I added, with a dryness that did not quite mask the strain, "this is about as much hidin’ as the law in this town is ever likely to do on your behalf. You stay inside these walls, you stay on this side of that door, and you may yet live long enough to tell your version under oath."  

The lamp’s glow reached farther now, painting the floorboards where old scuff marks, darker than the rest, crossed and recrossed in patterns that spoke—if a man let himself read them—of more traffic than a handful of drunks could account for. Sheriff Amos Reed noted the way Jesse’s gaze took it all in—the crates, the shoe, the shadowed corner where an iron ring still jutted from the stone—and felt, inconveniently, the matching catalog rise in his own head: dates, names, signatures filed in a locked box two rooms away. (Reed, you filed the paper that turned people into freight. Now you’re stowing one man away like contraband to keep him from the same machine.) "You wanted to see where Halter Creek keeps what it doesn’t care to admit to in daylight," I said, setting the lamp on a low shelf that had once held shackles and now bore only dust. "Congratulations. You’re lookin’ at it. Basement included."

============================================================


Clara Wynn:
The murmur at the door thinned, stretched, became something like a backdrop rather than a threat; the bar creaked under the sheriff’s weight and held. Inside, the room seemed suddenly larger around its quiet places—the desk, the shelves, the scatter of papers that smelled of dust and ink and the faint, metallic ghost of old coffee. My pulse, which had been counting each blow outside, shifted its attention inward. (You will make use of this moment. You will not simply stand and tremble while men decide the world over your head.) I let my hand slip from the chair back and move, as if by its own curiosity, to the edge of the sheriff’s blotter. The lamplight showed a muddle of documents there; bullets through a page, I thought, would make holes not only in the paper but in whatever story it tried to hold together. What stories are these, that require so much paper to keep them standing?

I turned aside one ledger, then another, careful, the way I would peel back layers in a student’s exercise to see where the first mistake had been made. Receipts. Wanted notices. A folded letter bearing the heavy, self-satisfied script I had seen before on town proclamations: Eli McCall, the M curling like a snake in tall grass. Under that, another hand entirely—tighter, eastern, ink blotted in the same place it always was when the writer’s temper caught up with his pen. My breath hitched. (Stop. This is not your drawer. This is not your past. Close it and sit down.) Instead, I opened the letter. The paper crackled in a way I knew too well; fine stock gone brittle, like pages from the bundle under my own schoolroom floor. "…re: Halter Creek parcels… outstanding dispute, Cole matter unresolved…" I whispered, the words flattening into the air between me and the cell, though I had not meant to give them voice at all. My father’s name at the bottom—initial only, but unmistakable—looked up at me like an eye.

Beneath that letter lay a sheaf of accounts, neat columns marching like drilled soldiers: payments from McCall Holdings, from an eastern syndicate I recognized as if from a bad dream, and then, circled once in Sheriff Reed’s cramped, reluctant script, a line item: Educational Improvements—Halter Creek, remitted via E.M.—amount beside it large enough to have built brick instead of wood. The number swam on the page, black ink turning slick, as if the storm had found a way in. "No," I said softly, and the word felt less like denial than inventory. "No… no, this isn’t—" (You will not be foolish. You have known, somewhere under your careful stories, you have known. Money does not blow in like seed on the wind. It comes on wagons. It comes on signatures. It comes on men like your father, like Eli McCall.) I turned one more page and found Jesse Cole’s name, written in the sheriff’s hand atop a copy of an older document—the same tidy legal phrasing I had glimpsed once years ago in my father’s study, when the word foreclosure had first learned to bare its teeth.

I sank down onto the edge of the sheriff’s chair without thinking, the wood hard under me, the papers light and treacherous in my lap. Outside, someone shouted McCall’s name, half curse, half prayer; inside, the names on the page crowded together until they blurred: McCall, Cole, Wynn. East and West meeting here, not at some grand junction of progress, but on a cheap wooden desk in a damp little jail. "All the same ink," I heard myself say, low and almost wonderingly. "All the same hands behind different doors." My fingers tightened on the edges of the documents until they cut. (You will fold these. You will remember every figure, every line, every lie of omission, and you will decide—quietly, carefully—whether your testimony belongs to this ledger of men, or to something cleaner. Order in your classroom, order in your conscience, order, if you can manage it, in this small corner of a world already stained.)

Sheriff Amos Reed:
The climb back up from the lower room, which had never seemed particularly long to Sheriff Amos Reed on prior occasions, put a thin sheen of sweat along my spine this time; by the second step my breath had shortened into that careful, measured draw a man uses when he does not wish to show he’s winded, and by the third there was a slow, sticky warmth working its way down my left side that I filed, for the record, under matters to be addressed if and when the night allowed. The passage opened back into the office with a small shift in air—from dust and stone and old ghosts to lamp oil, damp wool, and the faint metallic tang of coffee gone cold—and as I cleared the threshold my eyes went first, by habit, to the barred front door, then to the stove, then to the desk, where Clara Wynn now sat in my chair with a spread of papers in her lap and a look on her face that said, as clearly as any sworn statement, that some line had just been crossed that was not entirely of my choosing. (Reed, you should’ve locked more than the basement.)  

For a fraction of a heartbeat Sheriff Amos Reed stilled, the room taking on that peculiar clarity it sometimes had in the second before a fight—the lamplight catching not just on the edge of her spectacles and the ink-dark curve of the letters in her hand, but on particular words my mind supplied without needing to read them: HALTER CREEK PARCELS, COLE, WYNN, REMITTED VIA E.M. My first impulse, which would have involved a quick stride and a firmer hand than the law strictly sanctioned on a lady’s wrist, went past like a shadow on a wall; what came out instead was a slower exhale and a measured step toward the stove, as if I meant only to tend to the neglected coffee. "Miss Wynn," I said, setting the pot back on the hob without quite pouring, "I see you’ve made yourself acquainted with some of this office’s… older correspondence." The pause around that last phrase was small but not, to Sheriff Amos Reed’s ear, undetectable.  

I rested my good hand on the back of the spare chair, knuckles whitening just enough to betray the strain if a person were watching close. "Those ledgers and letters are, strictly speakin’, internal documents," I went on, keeping my tone level, almost dry. "Not evidence in the matter presently before us—at least, not in any formal sense." My gaze flicked to the sheet where her thumb covered half a signature I knew too well, then back to her eyes. "You’re not entirely wrong, though, if you’re thinkin’ they paint a certain picture of how money and land have moved through this town. Whose names got written neat at the top, whose disappeared into the fine print." Sheriff Amos Reed felt something old and sour shift under his breastbone as I said it, but the words, once started, would not entirely stop. "For the record, I don’t recall invitatin’ you to that particular view." A beat, softer. "Doesn’t mean you’re wrong to be lookin’."

Clara Wynn:
I did not rise when he came back; I only straightened in his chair, the papers in my lap suddenly weightier than any primer. Lamplight caught the damp at his temples, the strain at his knuckles on the chair back, and for a moment we were two figures on opposite sides of a schoolroom argument: teacher and older pupil, both knowing the other had seen too much. "Older correspondence," I repeated, carefully, as if testing a new word before handing it to the children. My thumb slid aside, exposing the line in his ledger he had circled. "Hal­ter Creek parcels. Cole matter unresolved. Educational Improvements—Halter Creek, remitted via E.M. And here"—I lifted the letter with the cracked, fine stock and held it so he could not miss the bottom corner—"an initial from an eastern office I know rather better than I would like. W. The same hand that signed away farms back East has been… advising Mr. McCall on his ‘parcels’ here." My voice tightened on that last word, thin wire drawn across a post. (You will not say Father. You will not let that name into this room. You will speak in ink, not in blood.)

I drew a breath that felt too large for my chest and let it out slowly, like calming a row of restive boys. "These are not, as you say, formal evidence of who fired a pistol in the rain," I allowed. "But they are evidence of something. Of whose names sit neat at the top of pages and whose are… squeezed into the margins, if they appear at all. Of how Jesse Cole’s family land could be called ‘disputed’ in an office a thousand miles away while his surname hangs on a wanted poster in your window." I glanced, just once, toward the cell—the shadowed line of his jaw, the chain, the way he watched without comment—and then back to Reed. (Do not look for sympathy there. Do not look for rescue. You are speaking for your students, for yourself, for whatever scrap of order you can salvage from this ledger.) "You said to those men outside that my word would decide what happens to him," I went on, the tremor in my hands migrating up into my throat. "But these pages say… my life here was bought, in part, by the same ink that threatened his, and by counsel from the same coast that ruined mine before." The admission cracked something in me, but on the other side of the crack there was a hard, clean edge.

"So I must ask you plainly, Sheriff Reed," I said, the title deliberate, the formality a rail I could hold to. "When they come again—and they will, with more rifles and less patience—will you protect Mr. Cole as a prisoner under the law, or will you hand him over and write it off as the town’s will? Will you stand by what you told them at that door, or will you let rope and storm finish what these ‘internal documents’ began?" The questions hung in the lamplight between us, bright and unforgiving as chalk on a slate. My fingers dug into the paper until the edge bit; I did not loosen them. (You will not plead. You will not turn away. Order in the classroom, order in the street, order in your trembling hands—if he means to add your name to this account, let him say it where you can hear.)

Sheriff Amos Reed:
Sheriff Amos Reed listened to her lay the names out—McCall, Cole, that eastern initial she would not quite give the dignity of a full word—and felt, with each one, that old ledger inside him flip to a page he’d hoped, not entirely realistically, would stay shut. My hand left the back of the chair and went instead to the edge of the desk, fingers splayed on the scarred wood beside the very column she’d uncovered, as if, by touching it, I might hold those figures in place and keep them from spilling into the rest of the room. "You’ve read it correct," I said after a moment, the words coming slow, as though they had to pass through paper before they could reach air. "Money for the schoolhouse, routed through Eli McCall’s books from an outfit back East that has, as a matter of fact, done business under more than one name. Advice, if you want to call it that, comin’ on fine stationery with initials I recognized when they first crossed this desk and chose, at the time, not to... inquire too hard about." My gaze went to the line marked COLE MATTER UNRESOLVED, the circle I’d drawn around it years later when the surname turned up again in a different context, under a bounty stamp. "I signed off on deeds tied to that advice," I went on, voice flattening a shade. "I took testimony I knew was, strictly speakin’, incomplete. I watched wagons roll out under cover of ‘voluntary relocation’ and told myself the law’s hands were cleaner than the men holdin’ the torches. That was not entirely true."  

I drew a breath then, careful of the pain under my ribs, and let my eyes meet hers without sliding away to the safer subjects of doors or mobs or coffee. "So, to answer your question plain," I said, "this sheriff has already once let ‘the town’s will’—and Eli McCall’s money—set the terms for who got to stay in this valley and who did not. I put my name on paper that turned families into freight. I’m not proud of that. It’s the reason I’ve kept this badge on when smarter men would’ve retired to a quieter county." A faint sound from outside—the scrape of a boot, someone testing the bar again—threaded through the quiet; Sheriff Amos Reed noted it, weighed it, and set it aside. "If they come again tonight with more rifles and less patience, if they push that door and demand Jesse Cole because their tempers and McCall’s history say a rope’s quicker than a trial, then for the record, I will not hand him over. Not as sheriff. Not as Amos Reed who remembers another time this town picked its villain and never looked too close at who was holdin’ the deed."  

I straightened a little, the movement small but deliberate, and set each condition out like a fencepost. "He may still hang," I said. "Judge may hear your statement, and his, and whatever else crawls out of these records, and put a noose ’round his neck legal as Sunday. If Eli dies and the evidence holds, that’s an outcome the law allows for. But it will be done in daylight, with a docket and a verdict and a preacher, not on a storm night off my jailhouse beam to satisfy men who’d rather not think about how this town got built. If they push that door, then someone is going to die on this side of it; I can’t guarantee it won’t be me, or you, or even Cole. What I can say—with as much certainty as a man like me is entitled to—is that it will not be because I stepped aside and called it the town’s will a second time."  

Sheriff Amos Reed glanced once toward the inner passage, where stone and dust and an old shoe bore silent witness, then back to the papers in her lap. "Those documents tie you to this place same as they tie me," I added, quieter. "Your school. My office. His land. All bought, in one way or another, with the same ink. I can’t unwrite that tonight. What I *can* do is draw one clear line and stand on it. Cole stays in my custody. The mob does not get him. If this town means to finish Eli McCall’s kind of work, it’ll have to do it over my body, not with my signature. That’s the best I’ve got to offer, Miss Wynn. It’s not a clean slate. But it’s a different page."
